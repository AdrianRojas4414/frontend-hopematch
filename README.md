# Hopematch Frontend

Hopematch is a platform that connects sponsors (Padrinos) with children in need (Niños). The frontend, built with Angular, provides an intuitive user interface for managing sponsorships, donations, and user interactions.

## How It Works

1. **Encargados** register children and update their needs.
2. **Padrinos** sign up, browse children’s profiles, and choose whom to sponsor.
3. Users can track donations and communicate through the platform.
4. The UI interacts with the Hopematch backend via RESTful APIs.
